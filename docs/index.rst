**NAME**


 ``operbot`` - write your own commands


**SYNOPSIS**


  | ``operbot [cmd] [-c] [-i] [key=value] [key==value]``


**INSTALL**


 ``pip3 install operbot --upgrade --force-reinstall``


**DESCRIPTION**


 ``operbot`` is a solid, non hackable, back after reboot, intended to be
 programmable in a static, only code, no popen, no imports and no reading
 modules from a directory bot, it's  source is :ref:`here <source>`.

 ``operbot`` is programmable, to program the bot you have to have the code
 available as employing your own code requires that you install your own bot as
 the system bot. This is to not have a directory to read modules from to add
 commands to the bot but include the own programmed modules directly into the
 python code, so only trusted code (your own written code) is included and
 runnable. Reading random code from a directory is what gets avoided.

 ``operbot`` stores it's data on disk where objects are time versioned and the
 last version saved on disk is served to the user layer. Files are JSON dumps
 that are read-only so thus should provide (disk) persistence more chance.
 Paths carry the type in the path name what makes reconstruction from filename
 easier then reading type from the object.
